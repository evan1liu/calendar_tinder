Does not have to be on Friday, can be on whatever day fits your schedule the best. If any questions about proper lifting technique for specific a specific exercise, do not attempt if unsure on technique to avoid risking injury. Ask coach or other team member who is experienced with lifting. Amount of weight used should be challenging on the last few reps but not maxing out- do not risk failure. If unsure of how much weight to use, start on the conservative/lighter side, and increase from there as you feel able.",
